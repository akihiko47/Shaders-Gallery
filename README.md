# ‚ú® Shaders ‚ú®

This repository stores shaders that I made by reading ["The book of shaders"](https://thebookofshaders.com/). 
Some of the shaders were inspired by shaders from the [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) website.

Many of them have settings such as color, etc. Feel free to use these shaders wherever you want!
